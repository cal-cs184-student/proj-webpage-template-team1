            <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
            <p>This was a pretty fun project to implement. We started by working on the physical properties — implementing spring physics and object collision — to implementing the shader program to be able to create lighting and material effects. </p>
            <p>    
                <p>Throughout the project, the implementations were pretty stragihtforward. In all parts, we just used the knowledge/formula from class and converted them into code. There were a few small bugs that came up. In part 1 & 2, we intially made some mistakes related to the spring types and their conditions as the conditions are very specific for each spring type. In part 4, self collision was not working properly because the z-coordinate had an integer rounding error from a previous part, although this was pretty easily fixed once we found the point of origination. Writing GLSL in part 5 was also a bit tricky since we didn't have the syntax/IDE tools that we're used to when writing c++, but none of the bugs were too difficult to squash. Additionally, we implemented some incorrect lighting for the phong shader file but later realized that it was because some of the inputs are not normalized.</p>
                I've learned that even in a seemingly simple simulation — a cloth falling — the implementation is still pretty lengthy. My final project, which is several times more complicated, will probably take lots of time to complete... so I should probably get started soon :)</p>

        <blockquote>
            <b>
                Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing <kbd>R</kbd>.
                <br />
                <small> Describe the effects of changing the spring constant <code>ks</code>; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low <code>ks</code>? A high <code>ks</code>? </small>
            </b>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The higher the ks, the more the center of the cloth sink (as well as other parts of the cloth) from the pinned height. For example, when density = 15g/cm^2, with k = 100000 N/m, the cloth barely sinks; however, with k = 1 N/m, the cloth significantly sinks down.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <b>
                <small> What about for <code>density</code>? </small>
            </b>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The change in density reacts inthen opposite direction to ks, which makes sense because the higher the mass/unit area, the more force it has, and therefore the more it sinks.
            For example, when density = 1g/cm^2 and ks = 5000N/m, the cloth barely sinks. On the other hand, when density = 100000g/cm^2, with the same ks, the cloth significantly sinks.
        </p>

                <small> What about for <code>damping</code>? </small>
            </b>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Damping just makes the cloth moves slower (or faster), both when it sinks or when it bounces back up. More specifically, when damping is high, the cloth moves slower, and vice versa.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <b>

        <blockquote><b> Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects. </b></blockquote>

        <p>Shader programs are used to create effects such as lighting and material textures. Vertex shaders are responsible for transforming the 3D geometry of a scene, such as the position and orientation of objects, into 2D coordinates on the screen. Meanwhile, fragment shaders are responsible for calculating the color and other properties of each pixel on the screen, based on the lighting and material properties of the objects in the scene.</p>

        <blockquote><b> Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model. </b></blockquote>

        <p>We've touched upon Blinn-Phong earlier in once of the past projects. Blinn-Phong considers three types of light: ambient, diffuse, and specular. For each type of light, in our shader, we assign k_a, k_d, k_s, which could be seen as their respective weights (setting any to 0 means removing that light our from our system). The final Blinn-Phong lighting model calculates the weighted sum of these three types of light.</p>
        <p>Ambient light can be thought of as the constant light that is uniform everywhere in the scene. Diffuse light depends of the angle between the surface normal and the light source: larger angle -> less light. Finally, Specular light depends on the angle betwen reflected light from the surface and viewer's direction, and it is used to give the surface shininess.</p>

        <p>We can see that the bump mapping and displacement mapping appear similar from far away, but upon closer inspection, the displacement mapping actually "displaces" the vertices, as the name suggest, leading to physical textures. Adjusting the resolution using <code>-o 128 -a 128</code> elads to the displacement mapping being more accurate to the texture itself. When it is set to 16, the physical deformations do not align with the color because the resolution is too low, whereas in the last picture, it actually lines up resulting in a nice brick ball!</p>
